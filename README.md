# Memphis Wildfire Impact

# Goal

This project involves creating a smoke impact estimate for an assigned U.S. city based on wildfire data from the past 60 years. Using this estimate, comparisons are drawn against EPA AQI data, and a predictive model is developed to forecast smoke impacts through 2050. The analysis aims to support civic institutions in making informed decisions on wildfire impact mitigation
