# Memphis Wildfire Impact

## Goal

The goal of this project is to estimate the future impact on year-over-year percentage changes in unemployment rates in Memphis, Tennessee, based on historical smoke exposure, weather, and economic data. To achieve this, the project developed two distinct models: a Smoke Impact Model and an Economic Impact Model. The Smoke Impact Model assesses the historical contribution of wildfire smoke, while the Economic Impact Model incorporates smoke exposure, NOAA weather data, and economic metrics to predict labor market outcomes. Together, these models provide data-driven insights that aim to help policymakers mitigate negative economic impacts, improve workforce resilience, and support proactive decision-making in response to increasing environmental hazards.

## Repo Setup / Model Information

This repo contains two separate directories for each of the models used in the project. Each directory also contains its own README file with more detailed information regarding the files saved in the directory. Please see below for links to these README files.
