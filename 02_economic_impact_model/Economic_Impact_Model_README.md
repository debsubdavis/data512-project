# Economic Impact Model

The Economic Impact Model predicts unemployment rates in Memphis by analyzing the combined effects of wildfire smoke exposure, economic trends, and weather conditions. It uses monthly BLS data on labor metrics and NOAA weather data from 2009-2020, along with smoke impact scores generated by the Smoke Impact Model. To maintain consistency across datasets, yearly smoke impact scores were converted into monthly values. Built with a gradient-boosted decision tree approach, the model captures complex relationships between these variables. Future predictions from 2025 to 2051 were made by estimating values for the model features using 5-year rolling averages

# Stage 2: Combined Analysis

### _Description_

Analyzes wildfire and air quality data to assess the impact of wildfires on air quality in Memphis. It processes distance data, fire statistics, and smoke impact estimates, filtering data for the fire season (May to October) and calculating annual averages. The script then visualizes the results through various plots, comparing scaled smoke impact estimates with AQI measurements over time and saving the output for further analysis.

# Stage 3: Model Training

### _Description_

Trains a model to predict the impact of wildfire smoke using a Gradient Boosting Regressor with optimized hyperparameters. It preprocesses and normalizes wildfire data, removes outliers, and applies bootstrapping with cross-validation to identify the model with the best performance. The final model is saved for future use, and residuals are plotted to visualize the model's accuracy in predicting smoke impact.

# Stage 4: Model Predictions

### _Description_

Generates future predictions for wildfire size, distance from Memphis, and associated smoke impact from 2025 to 2050. It calculates 5-year rolling averages of historical data to predict future fire trends, then normalizes and weights these predictions before applying a trained Gradient Boosting model to estimate smoke impact. Finally, the predicted smoke impact is visualized over time to analyze potential trends through 2050.
